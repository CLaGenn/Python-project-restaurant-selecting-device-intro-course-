# Python-project for introduction course
This program, known as the “Restaurant recommendations device”,  empowers users to explore curated dining options in Switzerland and Spain based on their personalized preferences. Users can choose between two datasets that were created at random for the sake of experimenting the efficiency of the program: Swiss_Restaurants and Spanish_Restaurants. After selecting one of the datasets, users can specify the desired criteria, including: city, food type, restaurant type, price range, and even Michelin star ratings. The program meticulously matches these preferences with the attributes of each restaurant in the dataset, utilizing specialized functions for each criterion. The two datasets need to be in the python program before running the code in different files named as Swiss_Restaurants and Spanish_Restaurants.
